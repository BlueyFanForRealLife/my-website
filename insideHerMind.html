    <p>Little A is three years old and her birthday was in December. She likes to spend her time outside but when it's
        too cold, she likes to watch tv, play with toys, and dance. She is very sassy and bossy and she knows what she
        wants and when she wants it. One thing Little A has picked up is the role of cleaning up doggy food dishes.She
        was not asked to perform this task, she simply learned it from observation. She is very good at that. Each
        evening when the puppies are done eating, she makes her rounds to gather their bowls for her Granny before they
        all go outside for a "potty" break. She has also mastered opening the door for the puppies to let them out or
        in. Sometimes it's at a time that is not convenient for Granny so she has taken to having to lock the door if
        they have to stay in. This doesn't tell Little A that she's in trouble for doing it, it just lets her know it's
        not time. Nevertheless Little A still knows that it is her duty to perform the task when it is time and she does
        it with glee. Little A is also very helpful in the garden when it is warm outside. She enjoys digging, gathering
        sticks, picking up garbage while wearing gloves, and spotting "puppy nuggets" so that Granny can pick them up
        and no one steps on them. Lately it's been really windy and cold in our area so she's been inside mostly. These
        days she's watching Bluey&trade; and trying to reenact what she sees. It's thanks to her that her father and I
        keep our
        imagination.</p>
