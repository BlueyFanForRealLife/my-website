        <p> Hi! We are the Shiners! We are a family of 3 humans and a Great Pyrenees. I met my husband through a
            couple of friends on Facebook. I drove them around for a third party transportation that had a contract
            for the railroad. He served with them through the National Guard until he was hurt too bad to serve. He
            messaged me in October of 2018 and two months later we were engaged. At the beginning of the pandemic in
            2020 we had no idea what was going on. So we flew to Las Vegas in February and were married on the 22nd.
            In April of 2020 we found out we were pregnant with our little girl who I will nicname Little A.</p>
            <img id="ultrasound" src="pictures-of-people/babysFirstPicture.jpg" alt="">

        <p> Come August we decided to leave WA state and drive with friends to Georgia where we eventually settled
            in Kennesaw. We found an apartment in October with just enough time to make a home that we could bring our
            newborn to. Since we weren't able to bring our pets with at first, my husband drove to retrieve them in
            November right before the baby was born. This would make it so they were settled in enough to be ready
            to meet their new baby human. In December our little girl came at 39 weeks by cesarian. We spent some
            more time in Kennesaw and decided to drive back up to WA state so Little A could meet the family.</p>

        <p> The meeting of family was bittersweet and now she's attatched to her granny's hip. I won't lie having
            the extra help has been nice. In April of 2023 we decided to purchase an RV since housing costs are so
            high including apartments. This decision has given us the freedom to travel and save money doing it.
            Now, I won't say that it's that much cheaper than renting an apartment or owning a house. However there
            are costs that do end up giving us a little more wiggle room financially. Plus Little A isn't at the age
            that she needs schooling yet. However, when she does reach that age she will be homeschooled and
            visiting the important national sites instead of only reading about them in books. Now that you've read
            a bit about us, take a look around the site and enjoy pictures of our adventures and take a look at what
            interests our little one currently. </p>
