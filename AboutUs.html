        <p>Hi! We are the Shiners. I met my husband through friends on Facebook. I was a driver for a third party
            company out of Seattle, WA that drove railroad crews to different locations. Through that job I made many
            friends I still have today. My husband served in in the WA National Guard for 11 years until he was
            evenutally medically discharged. He loved his job and his service to his country. A couple of guys he served
            with were also employed through the railroad. My husband was on Facebook one day in October 2018 and he came
            across my profile under the listing "Someone You May Know". So he sent me a message and I responded. The
            first day we met in person we hit it off. From then on I found my person and we were inseparable. Right
            about this time I had to move to an apartment in Lakewood, WA. The drive was tedious but I made it and so
            did he. A few months later I moved him into my apartment. In December 2018 we were engaged. I couldn't wait
            to start planning. As the months dragged on, we moved closer to my job, I found the dress, we tasted food,
            and picked out colors. As we got closer to the date, the more overwhelmed we got. Weddings get expensive and
            when you're unable to save it gets hard. So we decided to break down and just "go to Vegas". Luckily we
            hadn't put any deposits down yet so we had the funds for the flight and hotel. For a gift my mother-in-law
            gave us spending money and paid for the wedding. So February 20, 2020 we flew to Las Vegas, NV and checked
            into our hotel. The wedding was small and cute and we had his cousin and cousin-in-law as witnesses. We
            spent the next three days walking and exploring around Las Vegas and flew home on February 25th. We moved
            back to his home town right after we got back and little did we know, we'd have a surprise coming. </p>

        <br>
        <p> In April 2020 we found out I was pregnant with our little bean. During this time the country was going
            through the Covid-19 pandemic so I was going to doctor appointments alone. The first ultrasound was gut
            wrenching because it was the first time I heard the baby's heartbeat. I couldn't facetime my husband at the
            time so it had to be on video. He did get to see the first pictures of our little baby. A few months later
            we found out that not only was I having a girl, but she also had a small hole in her heart. Due to my age
            being over 35 I was already a high risk pregnancy. Now because she had what was called VSD or Ventrical
            Septal Defect I was definitely high risk and needing weekly ultrasounds. More often fetuses that have this
            disorder end up having the hole close before birth or within the first year. This was the case with our
            little one. At the same time we found out I was expecting, my best friend and her family found out that her
            husband recieved a job transfer to Georgia. Fast forward to August, we decided we would caravan along with
            them. I was 19 weeks along when we left WA state bound for Georgia. We saw sights like the Badlands,
            Sturgis, Mt. Rushmore, and tons more. When I was 20 weeks along we had stopped for the night in Sioux Falls,
            SD. The next morning I had the painful feeling of what I didn't know was Braxton Hicks. So we made our way
            to the ER and eventually Labor & Delivery. Thankfully that was all it was and the doctor told me to walk
            more and drink more water which I followed as best as I could. We finally reached Kennesaw, Georgia mid
            August 2020 and found the hotel we would be staying in at first. About a month later we moved to a better
            hotel that we stayed in until we eventually found an apartment in October 2020. We left our pets in WA with
            my mother-in-law so in November that same year, my husband drove up to retrieve them. During this time I
            stayed with my best friend and her family so that I had someone with me should our little bean tried to come
            early. Thankfully he got back mid-November with enough time to get them settled to the apartment. Finally
            December arrived and I got my nesting bug. I decorated for Christmas like crazy. Even though it was best
            that I spent the first few weeks at my best friend's house since it was a single story, I decorated as if I
            was coming home. I even hung a "Baby's First Christmas" stocking with care. Finally it was Delivery day. I
            delivered a healthy baby girl by cesarian at 5:30 pm. She came out with ten fingers and toes and a healthy 7
            lbs. 14 oz. It was love at first scream. At 9 months we had to use a timeshare week that we got while in
            Vegas so we took Little A to Disney World. The pandemic still meant social distancing and masks so Character
            Meetings had fences between but she wasn't old enough to care. She just has pictures for memories and a love
            for Mickey and Minnie. We spent another year in Kennesaw, GA before we decided to go home to visit family
            and introduce Little A. The road trip home was full of events. We stayed in hotels, saw farm animals, ate
            fast and junk food, and Little A met her daddy's second cousin who is only about a month older than her.
            After L.A. it was the last leg home. We had to stop for the night in Seaside, OR after Little A got sick all
            over her carseat. We had to wash the seat cover so she had a clean seat to sit in. Now we keep vomit bags in
            every car we get in just in case. The next day we were finally on the way home.</p>

        <br>
        <p> The meeting of family was bittersweet. Little A took to her Granny instantly and absolutely loves her. She
            got to meet her Auntie she calls Auntie Deedaw. She gets to play with her cousin when it's nice and there's
            no school. About six months after we got to WA, we finally broke down and bought an RV. We full time live in
            it and are still learning how to break a one bedroom apartment down into a little RV. We are learning as we
            go how to exist together in a small space. There are easy days and there are not so easy days. We wouldn't
            trade it for an apartment at all any day. This RV gives us the freedom to travel and sightsee while teaching
            our daughter about the history of this country and beyond. Education is important and I'm also finding
            myself back in school. I plan to go into Photography and I found a class that I didn't know I'd be
            interested in but I am. There's actually a couple of classes so far. The instructors are understanding and
            helpful which is something I appreciate greatly. When I get done with school I hope to know how to turn
            pictures that I've taken over the years and turn them into something special. Due to the pandemic I didn't
            get maternity or newborn photos. So I hope to take the pictures I have taken and make them look more
            proffesional. So now that you've learned more about the last six years, enjoy looking around at the other
            links with pictures and details. </p>
