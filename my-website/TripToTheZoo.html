                <h3>Zoos and Aquariums</h2>
                <p>Zoos and Aquariums are good places for people of all ages to be educated about wildlife and
                    conservation. With wildlife animals coming extint quicker each year, it's important to let the next
                    generations know how important they are to our enviroment. We try to take pictures of the animals
                    along with their name and decription placards. Sometimes it is a little tougher with a toddler
                    running around so we don't get all of the animals we visit.</p>

                <h3>Disney World and Other Road Trips</h2>
                <p>At 9 months little A learned to walk. A little over 10 months she got to go to Disney World. In a
                    time where safe distancing and masks were important, she got to experience what took her mother and
                    father many years to experience. Here's some pictures of the parks and our family experiencing it.
