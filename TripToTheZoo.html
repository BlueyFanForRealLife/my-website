                <h2>Zoos and Aquariums</h2>
                <p>Zoos and Aquariums are good places for people of all ages to be educated about wildlife and
                    conservation. With wildlife animals coming extint quicker each year, it's important to let the next
                    generations know how
                    important they are to our enviroment. We try to take pictures of the animals along with their name
                    and
                    decription placards. Sometimes it is a little tougher with a toddler running around so we don't get
                    all of
                    the animals we visit.</p>

                <p>At 9 months little A learned to walk. A little over 19 months she got to go to Disney World. In a
                    time where safe distancing and masks were important, she got to experience what took her mother and
                    father many years to experience. Here's some pictures of the parks and our family experiencing it.</p>
